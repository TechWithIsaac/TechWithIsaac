# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, welcome to my github page!

## About me / Experience 
**I am a software developer from the the US who loves Jesus and programming, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or anything else.** 
- **I have experience in the list of items below (Decending order of experience)**:

  - **Python** - It is the language I most specialize in. I have worked with many of the modules including PyGame, Django, Tensorflow, Selenium, etc.
  - **Linux** - Linux is a tool in which I use all day every day, and have a strongsuit with.
  - **Git/Github**  - Git/Github is a tool I use very often, and am very confortable working with.
  - **Javascript, CSS, HTML** - I have a good amount of experience using Javascript, CSS, and HTML, but are overall less comfortable using them compared to Python.
  - **C#/Java** - I put these in the same category because of their similarities and the amount of experience I have with each one of them. I have minimal                             experience with either, but can work with them if need be. 
  - **Docker** - Lastly is Docker, I have minimal experience with it but can work with it, just as with C# or Java.
